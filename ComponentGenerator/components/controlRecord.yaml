#Control Record   - name
#Not really much here
#Used for financial management to define fiscal paramaters
component_name: ControlRecord
# A control record is just that a base component is only used within a view
# so does not need a wrapper class
# For a record the type object could be changed to record.... maybe
# that however is not a valid schema keyword
#The prefix can/should be extracted into its own schema?
#not sure yet.... for the moment it is here
