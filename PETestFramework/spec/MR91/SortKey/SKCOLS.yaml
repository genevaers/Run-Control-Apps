description: "Test column assignments to Sort Key Column from different\n\t\ttypes\
  \ and sources\n\t\tSort Key Columns check can be of the types with or without dates.\n\
  \t\tWe need to check for the generation of SKE, SKL, SKA, and SKC\n\t\tA full check\
  \ of all the types is probably not needed since the\n\t\tassignment check table\n\
  \t\tIs the same as used for normal fields\n\t\tWe do need to check for an invalid\
  \ sort key (not found)\n\t\tFor each of the SK instruction types.\n\t\tAnd to make\
  \ the error messages specific to sort keys?\n\t\tDoes it make sense to have a masked\
  \ numeric sort key column?"
